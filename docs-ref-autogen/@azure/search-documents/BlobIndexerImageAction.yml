  <xref:@azure/search-documents.KnownBlobIndexerImageAction> can be used
  interchangeably with BlobIndexerImageAction,
   this enum contains the known values that the service supports.
  ### Know values supported by the service

  **none**: Ignores embedded images or image files in the data set.  This is the
  default. \

  **generateNormalizedImages**: Extracts text from images (for example, the word
  "STOP" from a traffic stop sign), and embeds it into the content field.  This
  action requires that "dataToExtract" is set to "contentAndMetadata".  A
  normalized image refers to additional processing resulting in uniform image
  output, sized and rotated to promote consistent rendering when you include
  images in visual search results. This information is generated for each image
  when you use this option. \

  **generateNormalizedImagePerPage**: Extracts text from images (for example,
  the word "STOP" from a traffic stop sign), and embeds it into the content
  field, but treats PDF files differently in that each page will be rendered as
  an image and normalized accordingly, instead of extracting embedded images. 
  Non-PDF file types will be treated the same as if "generateNormalizedImages"
  was set.
