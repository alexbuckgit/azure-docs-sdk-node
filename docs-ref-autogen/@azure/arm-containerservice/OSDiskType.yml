  ### Known values supported by the service

  **Managed**: Azure replicates the operating system disk for a virtual machine
  to Azure storage to avoid data loss should the VM need to be relocated to
  another host. Since containers aren't designed to have local state persisted,
  this behavior offers limited value while providing some drawbacks, including
  slower node provisioning and higher read\/write latency. \

  **Ephemeral**: Ephemeral OS disks are stored only on the host machine, just
  like a temporary disk. This provides lower read\/write latency, along with
  faster node scaling and cluster upgrades.
