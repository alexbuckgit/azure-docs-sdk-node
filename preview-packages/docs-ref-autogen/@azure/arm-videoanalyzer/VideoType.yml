  ### Known values supported by the service

  **Archive**: Archive is flexible format that represents a video stream
  associated with wall-clock time. The video archive can either be continuous or
  discontinuous. An archive is discontinuous when there are gaps in the
  recording due to various reasons, such as the live pipeline being stopped,
  camera being disconnected or due to the use of event based recordings through
  the use of a signal gate. There is no limit to the archive duration and new
  video data can be appended to the existing archive at any time, as long as the
  same video codec and codec parameters are being used. Videos of this type are
  suitable for appending and long term archival. \

  **File**: File represents a video which is stored as a single media file, such
  as MP4. Videos of this type are suitable to be downloaded for external
  consumption.
