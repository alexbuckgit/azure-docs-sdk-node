    summary: >-
      Ephemeral OS disks are stored only on the host machine, just like a
      temporary disk. This provides lower read/write latency, along with faster
      node scaling and cluster upgrades.

    summary: >-
      Azure replicates the operating system disk for a virtual machine to Azure
      storage to avoid data loss should the VM need to be relocated to another
      host. Since containers aren't designed to have local state persisted, this
      behavior offers limited value while providing some drawbacks, including
      slower node provisioning and higher read/write latency.
