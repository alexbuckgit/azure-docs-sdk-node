      Extracts text from images (for example, the word "STOP" from a traffic
      stop sign), and embeds it into the content field, but treats PDF files
      differently in that each page will be rendered as an image and normalized
      accordingly, instead of extracting embedded images.  Non-PDF file types
      will be treated the same as if "generateNormalizedImages" was set.

    summary: >-
      Extracts text from images (for example, the word "STOP" from a traffic
      stop sign), and embeds it into the content field.  This action requires
      that "dataToExtract" is set to "contentAndMetadata".  A normalized image
      refers to additional processing resulting in uniform image output, sized
      and rotated to promote consistent rendering when you include images in
      visual search results. This information is generated for each image when
      you use this option.

      Ignores embedded images or image files in the data set.  This is the
