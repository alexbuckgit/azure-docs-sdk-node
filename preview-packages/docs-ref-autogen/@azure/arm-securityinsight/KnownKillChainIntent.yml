fields:
  - name: Collection
    uid: '@azure/arm-securityinsight.KnownKillChainIntent.Collection'
    package: '@azure/arm-securityinsight'
    summary: >-
      Collection consists of techniques used to identify and gather information,
      such as sensitive files, from a target network prior to exfiltration. This
      category also covers locations on a system or network where the adversary
      may look for information to exfiltrate.
  - name: CommandAndControl
    uid: '@azure/arm-securityinsight.KnownKillChainIntent.CommandAndControl'
    package: '@azure/arm-securityinsight'
    summary: >-
      The command and control tactic represents how adversaries communicate with
      systems under their control within a target network.
  - name: CredentialAccess
    uid: '@azure/arm-securityinsight.KnownKillChainIntent.CredentialAccess'
    package: '@azure/arm-securityinsight'
    summary: >-
      Credential access represents techniques resulting in access to or control
      over system, domain, or service credentials that are used within an
      enterprise environment. Adversaries will likely attempt to obtain
      legitimate credentials from users or administrator accounts (local system
      administrator or domain users with administrator access) to use within the
      network. With sufficient access within a network, an adversary can create
      accounts for later use within the environment.
  - name: DefenseEvasion
    uid: '@azure/arm-securityinsight.KnownKillChainIntent.DefenseEvasion'
    package: '@azure/arm-securityinsight'
    summary: >-
      Defense evasion consists of techniques an adversary may use to evade
      detection or avoid other defenses. Sometimes these actions are the same as
      or variations of techniques in other categories that have the added
      benefit of subverting a particular defense or mitigation.
  - name: Discovery
    uid: '@azure/arm-securityinsight.KnownKillChainIntent.Discovery'
    package: '@azure/arm-securityinsight'
    summary: >-
      Discovery consists of techniques that allow the adversary to gain
      knowledge about the system and internal network. When adversaries gain
      access to a new system, they must orient themselves to what they now have
      control of and what benefits operating from that system give to their
      current objective or overall goals during the intrusion. The operating
      system provides many native tools that aid in this post-compromise
      information-gathering phase.
  - name: Execution
    uid: '@azure/arm-securityinsight.KnownKillChainIntent.Execution'
    package: '@azure/arm-securityinsight'
    summary: >-
      The execution tactic represents techniques that result in execution of
      adversary-controlled code on a local or remote system. This tactic is
      often used in conjunction with lateral movement to expand access to remote
      systems on a network.
  - name: Exfiltration
    uid: '@azure/arm-securityinsight.KnownKillChainIntent.Exfiltration'
    package: '@azure/arm-securityinsight'
    summary: >-
      Exfiltration refers to techniques and attributes that result or aid in the
      adversary removing files and information from a target network. This
      category also covers locations on a system or network where the adversary
      may look for information to exfiltrate.
  - name: Exploitation
    uid: '@azure/arm-securityinsight.KnownKillChainIntent.Exploitation'
    package: '@azure/arm-securityinsight'
    summary: >-
      Exploitation is the stage where an attacker manage to get foothold on the
      attacked resource. This stage is applicable not only for compute hosts,
      but also for resources such as user accounts, certificates etc.
      Adversaries will often be able to control the resource after this stage.
  - name: Impact
    uid: '@azure/arm-securityinsight.KnownKillChainIntent.Impact'
    package: '@azure/arm-securityinsight'
    summary: >-
      The impact intent primary objective is to directly reduce the availability
      or integrity of a system, service, or network; including manipulation of
      data to impact a business or operational process. This would often refer
      to techniques such as ransom-ware, defacement, data manipulation and
      others.
  - name: LateralMovement
    uid: '@azure/arm-securityinsight.KnownKillChainIntent.LateralMovement'
    package: '@azure/arm-securityinsight'
    summary: >-
      Lateral movement consists of techniques that enable an adversary to access
      and control remote systems on a network and could, but does not
      necessarily, include execution of tools on remote systems. The lateral
      movement techniques could allow an adversary to gather information from a
      system without needing additional tools, such as a remote access tool. An
      adversary can use lateral movement for many purposes, including remote
      Execution of tools, pivoting to additional systems, access to specific
      information or files, access to additional credentials, or to cause an
      effect.
  - name: Persistence
    uid: '@azure/arm-securityinsight.KnownKillChainIntent.Persistence'
    package: '@azure/arm-securityinsight'
    summary: >-
      Persistence is any access, action, or configuration change to a system
      that gives an adversary a persistent presence on that system. Adversaries
      will often need to maintain access to systems through interruptions such
      as system restarts, loss of credentials, or other failures that would
      require a remote access tool to restart or alternate backdoor for them to
      regain access.
  - name: PrivilegeEscalation
    uid: '@azure/arm-securityinsight.KnownKillChainIntent.PrivilegeEscalation'
    package: '@azure/arm-securityinsight'
    summary: >-
      Privilege escalation is the result of actions that allow an adversary to
      obtain a higher level of permissions on a system or network. Certain tools
      or actions require a higher level of privilege to work and are likely
      necessary at many points throughout an operation. User accounts with
      permissions to access specific systems or perform specific functions
      necessary for adversaries to achieve their objective may also be
      considered an escalation of privilege.
  - name: Probing
    uid: '@azure/arm-securityinsight.KnownKillChainIntent.Probing'
    package: '@azure/arm-securityinsight'
    summary: >-
      Probing could be an attempt to access a certain resource regardless of a
      malicious intent or a failed attempt to gain access to a target system to
      gather information prior to exploitation. This step is usually detected as
      an attempt originating from outside the network in attempt to scan the
      target system and find a way in.
  - name: Unknown
    uid: '@azure/arm-securityinsight.KnownKillChainIntent.Unknown'
    package: '@azure/arm-securityinsight'
    summary: The default value.
