      The maximum allowed percentage of services health degradation allowed
      during cluster upgrades.

      The delta is measured between the state of the services at the beginning
      of upgrade and the state of the services at the time of the health
      evaluation.

      The check is performed after every upgrade domain upgrade completion to
      make sure the global state of the cluster is within tolerated limits.
