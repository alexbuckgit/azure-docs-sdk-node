      The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy applications before reporting
      an error. For example, to allow 10% of applications to be unhealthy, this
      value would be 10.

      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of applications
      that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.

      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
      application, the health is evaluated as Warning.

      This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy applications over
      the total number of application instances in the cluster, excluding
      applications of application types that are included in the
      ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap.

      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
      applications. Default percentage is zero.

    summary: >+
      The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy nodes before reporting an
      error. For example, to allow 10% of nodes to be unhealthy, this value
      would be 10.

      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of nodes that
      can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.

      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy node,
      the health is evaluated as Warning.

      The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy nodes
      over the total number of nodes in the cluster.

      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
      nodes. Default percentage is zero.


      In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for repairs, so
      this percentage should be configured to tolerate that.
